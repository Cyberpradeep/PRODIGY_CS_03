# Password Strength Checker

This project is a simple tool written in Java that checks the strength of a password. It evaluates the password based on a few important factors like its length, whether it has uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and special characters. After evaluating, it gives feedback on whether the password is **Very Strong**, **Strong**, **Medium**, **Weak**, or **Very Weak**.

## Features

- **Uppercase Letter**: The password should have at least one uppercase letter.
- **Lowercase Letter**: The password should have at least one lowercase letter.
- **Digit**: The password should have at least one number.
- **Special Character**: The password should have at least one special character (e.g., `!`, `@`, `#`).
